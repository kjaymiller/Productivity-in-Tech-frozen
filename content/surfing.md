 The thing about being a multi-potentialite that is so much fun is that everything comes in waves. It's like surfing. 

Some days are flat and you can't catch an (inspiration wave) to save your life!

Sometimes it's like that for days, weeks, months.

Then, with a little luck, a lot of planning, and maybe a change of scenery (sometimes, its all about Location, Location, Location), you are able to catch a Killer Wave that you ride for what feels like forever. 

If the water is flat, that's okay there's plenty of water out there and you just have to keep looking for that wave!
