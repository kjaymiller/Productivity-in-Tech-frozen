title: Offloading a Bit of the Editing can Help you be (More) Productive

Having created content around Productivity in Tech has given me many editing
skills.

## Podcast or Video Course Editing
You can make your podcast sound amazing with some work, but according to the
Paretto Principle, you should be focusing on the 20% of podcasting that gives
80% of the return. 

That 20% is recording the thing. 

In fact many people record ideas for podcasts bnd courses ut they never get published
because of the daunting task of editing.
