subtitle: Productivity in Tech makes Things for Tech Creators


## Here is a list of tools that PIT is working on to help tech creators.

- [Transcriptor](https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor)
- [Render Engine](https://render=engine.site)


**All projects are Open Source under the [MIT Licensed](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).**

This means that while some of the tools can be used for pay as a service, I am okay with you implementing your own local versions free of charge.
