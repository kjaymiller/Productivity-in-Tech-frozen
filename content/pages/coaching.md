Productivity in Tech provides coaching people in the tech space.

Whether you have a system in place or you are just getting started. We can help you find clarity in your process. 

## We Know About Productivity AND We Know About Tech
The biggest challenge in finding a productivity coach that works for you is finding one that understands what you do.

<p class="font-italic">I wanted to focus on my career. I knew I wasn't very proactive or productive anymore and so I thought a productivity coach sounded practical." I know (Jay is) passionate about this... so you seemed perfect.</p>

That and I couldn't afford $150-$500 a session.

I have productivity coaching experience as I have worked with other productivity coaches for the past 5 years. 

I also am an active developer and spend the majority of my day working in the tech space. So whether you are a developer, designer, system administrator. I speak your language. I know your struggles, and I have helped others like you!

I've been helping people be more productive for over a decade.


## Coaching That You Can Afford
My productivity story comes from when I was a junior level team member for a small IT department. I didn't know how to be productive and was struggling to be an effective employee. I looked at many different coaches but they had one thing in common. 

### I Couldn't Afford Them!
I value my time, but I also know that there has to be a way to make coaching affordable. My coaching methodology is similar to that of therapy.\*\*
There will be times when you need to work with me a lot and times when you will need to work with me a little. You only pay when we connect online or over the phone. 

If you have a quick thought or concern we can work on that for free. You only pay when it's time to get done to work!

<h2>We Make Sure That I'm the Right Coach for You Before You Pay</h2>
The first call that we do is a free consultation. In that call I learn about what issues you are running into and let you know what my planned approach would be.
