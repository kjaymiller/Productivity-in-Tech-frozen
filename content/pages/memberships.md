"I wanted to <b>focus</b> on my career. I knew I wasn't very proactive or productive in that area so I thought a productivity coach sounded practical. I knew Jay was passionate about this from listening to his podcast for so long. That and unlike some of the other coaches I looked into, I could actually afford his coaching."
