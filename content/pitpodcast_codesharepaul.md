Paul is an umbrage developer and a pool fanatic. He hated searching for all of the latest pool matches and decided to work on building a platform for people to search for matches and watch them, regardless of where they were hosted. 

In this conversation we talk about the pressure behind building something that you feel lead to build and what's it's like to "Just Ship It!".
