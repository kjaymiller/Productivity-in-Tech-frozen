title: Thinking about the move from Side Quest to Main Quest with Al Rodriguez
slug: pitpodcast-alrodriguez
summary: Al has been working on his side hustle on and off for the last 6 years. I sit down with Al and try to dissect some of the things keeping him at his 9-5 and what we can do to transform our side quest into a main quest.
