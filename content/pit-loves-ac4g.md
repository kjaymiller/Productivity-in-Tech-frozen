## Productivity in Tech is serious about _#diversityinTech_.

In Celebration of _#InternationalWomensMonth_, PIT is going to be donating $10 for each new member we get to [App Camp 4 Girls](https://appcamp4girls.com) in the month of March.

App Camp for Girls is a one-week summer day program where girls, transgender & gender non-conforming youth not just learn about development in swift, but also make a full blown app.
