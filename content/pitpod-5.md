This week on the Productivity In Tech Podcast, We have John Knox.

John moved to Minneapolis Minnesota from the tech hub of Austin Texas. During this move, John had to apply to several companies before landing at Prevent Biometrics. In this conversation, we talk about what it was like going from a tech come to a non-tech hub city and we cover but both candidates and companies can do better in the hiring process.
