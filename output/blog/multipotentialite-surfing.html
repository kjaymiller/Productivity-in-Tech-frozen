<p>The thing about being a multi-potentialite that is so much fun is that everything comes in waves. It's like surfing. </p>
<p>Some days are flat and you can't catch an (inspiration wave) to save your life!</p>
<p>Sometimes it's like that for days, weeks, months.</p>
<p>Then, with a little luck, a lot of planning, and maybe a change of scenery (sometimes, its all about Location, Location, Location), you are able to catch a Killer Wave that you ride for what feels like forever. </p>
<p>If the water is flat, that's okay there's plenty of water out there and you just have to keep looking for that wave!</p>
