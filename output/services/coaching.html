<h2>We Know About Productivity AND We Know About Tech</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge in finding a productivity coach that works for you is finding one that understands what you do.</p>

"I wanted to <b>focus</b> on my career. I knew I wasn't very proactive or productive in that area so I thought a productivity coach sounded practical. I knew Jay was passionate about this from listening to his podcast for so long. That and unlike some of the other coaches I looked into, I could actually afford his coaching."

<p>I have productivity coaching experience as I have worked with other productivity coaches for the past 5 years. </p>
<p>I also am an active developer and spend the majority of my day working in the tech space. So whether you are a developer, designer, system administrator. I speak your language. I know your struggles, and I have helped others like you!</p>
<p>I've been helping people be more productive for over a decade.</p>
<h2>Coaching That You Can Afford</h2>
<p>My productivity story comes from when I was a junior level team member for a small IT department. I didn't know how to be productive and was struggling to be an effective employee. I looked at many different coaches but they had one thing in common. </p>
<h3>I Couldn't Afford Them!</h3>
<p>I value my time, but I also know that there has to be a way to make coaching affordable. My coaching methodology is similar to that of therapy.**
There will be times when you need to work with me a lot and times when you will need to work with me a little. You only pay when we connect online or over the phone. </p>
<p>If you have a quick thought or concern we can work on that for free. You only pay when it's time to get done to work!</p>
