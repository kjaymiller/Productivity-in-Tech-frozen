      Need Help Getting Productive?
	<div class="py-2">
		<p>Whether you have a system in place or you are just getting started. I can help you find <strong>clarity in your process.</strong> ## We Know About Productivity AND We Know About TechThe biggest challenge in finding a productivity coach that works for you is finding one that understands what you do.<blockquote class="blockquote text-center"><p class="font-italic">"I wanted to <b>focus</b> on my career. I knew I wasn't very proactive or productive in that area so I thought a productivity coach sounded practical. I knew Jay was passionate about this from listening to his podcast for so long. That and unlike some of the other coaches I looked into, I could actually afford his coaching."</p>- Chris J.</blockquote>I have productivity coaching experience as I have worked with other productivity coaches for the past 5 years. I also am an active developer and spend the majority of my day working in the tech space. So whether you are a developer, designer, system administrator. I speak your language. I know your struggles, and I have helped others like you!I've been helping people be more productive for over a decade.## Coaching That You Can AffordMy productivity story comes from when I was a junior level team member for a small IT department. I didn't know how to be productive and was struggling to be an effective employee. I looked at many different coaches but they had one thing in common. ### I Couldn't Afford Them!I value my time, but I also know that there has to be a way to make coaching affordable. My coaching methodology is similar to that of therapy.**There will be times when you need to work with me a lot and times when you will need to work with me a little. You only pay when we connect online or over the phone. If you have a quick thought or concern we can work on that for free. You only pay when it's time to get done to work!<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6"><h2>We Make Sure That I'm the Right Coach for You Before You Pay</h2>The first call that we do is a free consultation. In that call I learn about what issues you are running into and let you know what my planned approach would be. Let's take the first step and learn if I can help you become (More) Productive<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">  <p>    <label>Your Name: <input type="text" name="name" /></label>     </p>  <p>    <label>Your Email: <input type="email" name="email" /></label>  </p>  <p>    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">I would like a free productivity coaching      assessment.</button>  </p></form></div><div class="col-md-5"><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/WAX_0357.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain;"></div></div><sub>** Productivity in Tech does not claim to provide any type of therapy business and should not be used in substitution of seeing a mental health professional.</sub></p>
