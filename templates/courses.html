    A podcast is a way to share the skills that you have developed over
    your career with others.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's also a way to connect with other developers and learn new things to improve your skill set.

     <p>As of 2018 Apple has added 660,000 podcasts to its podcast directory with close to 28 million episodes published.</p>

<p>That may seem like a lot of competition, but the average show makes less than 50 episodes in it&#8217;s lifetime. While some podcasts last for years, a large number make it less than 15 episodes.</p>

<p>Most podcasts don&#8217;t meet their creators expectations, not because of lack of listeners, but lack of planning.</p>
